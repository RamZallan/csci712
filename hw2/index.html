        <p>Object balls are removed when they hit a pocket, while the cue is put in the center of the table.</p>
        <p>The cue ball will automatically hit the others on load, or you can use WASD to control its movement.</p>
        <p>Press z to set the coefficient of restitution for ball-cushion collisions to 0.9, and x to reset to 0.5.</p>
